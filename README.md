# GameHub  

GameHub was my first personal project, and it has a special place for me—not just because it was my first, but also because it's dedicated to my YouTube channel. My goal was to create a more engaging way to showcase my playlists. I've been making content on YouTube since 2019, so over time, I've built up a collection of playlists for different games.  

One of the biggest limitations on YouTube is that you can't customize playlist covers. With this project, I not only have full control over the visuals but also how they respond to user interactions—adjusting the layout, colors, and overall experience. This adds a unique touch and makes everything feel more dynamic.

## Evolution  

When I first built this project, I had zero experience with JavaScript. The page was completely static, had no responsiveness, and only a handful of basic features.  

After refactoring, I made it fully responsive across different screen sizes, including phones, tablets, and TVs. I also focused on improving the overall UX/UI. Adding interactive elements that respond to user input made a huge difference—it turned a simple project into something much more polished and engaging.

## Tech Stack  

I used the **YouTube API** to pull real-time subscriber data. For security reasons, I haven’t shared my API key, but you can request your own from [Google Developers](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) to access Google and YouTube APIs.  

The project was built with **HTML** and **CSS**, while **JavaScript** handles effects and interactions. For responsiveness, I used **media queries** to ensure a smooth experience across all screen sizes.
